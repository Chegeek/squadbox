## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code! Please report unacceptable behavior to [squadbox@mit.edu](mailto:squadbox@mit.edu).

## What we're working on
Our main goal right now is to get Squadbox in solid shape to release it widely to the public. We've only tested with a small number of users so far and there are many areas we need to improve. Take a look at the issues in our [current milestone](https://github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox/milestone/1) or browse some [good first issues](https://github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get started!

After that, we hope to build integrations for Squadbox to be used with other communication platforms besides email.

## How to contribute

1. **Comment on the issue and introduce yourself!** Let us know you're working on it, so we don't duplicate work. This will also be a good time for you to ask us any questions you may have about the issue and for us to provide additional context to you. 
2. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and keep in sync with the main one. 
3. **Check out a new branch** on your fork of the repository. Give it a descriptive name, like "readme-update" or "reply-bug". Make your changes on that branch. (If you're working on a coding issue, follow the [coding setup](/coding_setup.md) instructions to get all set up on your computer.
4. **Commit your changes**. Use a descriptive commit message!  
5. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)** to merge your changes into the master branch. This opens a discussion around your changes and lets us know you are proposing them!
