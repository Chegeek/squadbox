Fight harassment with your squad. Learn more at [squadbox.org](http://squadbox.org).

## Hi!
Thanks for checking out our repository! [Squadbox](squadbox.org) is a tool to help people who are being harassed online by having their friends (or “squad”) moderate their messages. 

In this README we cover:
* [The motivation behind the project](#motivation)
* [A broad overview of how it works](#how-it-works)
* [Who we are](#who-we-are)
* [What we need help with](#what-we-need-help-with)
* [How you can get involved!](#getting-involved)

## Motivation

## How it Works

## Who We Are
We ([@amyxzhang](http://www.github.com/amyxzhang), [@kmahar](http://www.github.com/kmahar), [@karger](http://www.github.com/karger)) are a team of human-computer interaction researchers from the [Haystack Group](http://haystack.csail.mit.edu/) at [MIT CSAIL](http://www.csail.mit.edu/). 
While this started as a research project, with the help of the Mozilla Foundation's [Open Leaders program](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/), we are now working to convert it to a full-fledged open source project in order to expand the number of people contributing and maximize the project's impact.

Please feel free to reach out to us on Github or via email at [squadbox@mit.edu](mailto:squadbox@mit.edu)!

## What We Need Help With

## Getting Involved 
We use the [issue tracker](http://www.github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox/issues) to keep a list of work to be done on the project. We have a label for "good first issues" for getting your feet wet - you can see those issues [here](https://github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). If you're interested in working on one of them, go ahead and comment and we'll help you get started!

We have both coding and non-coding issues you can work on - while most on the list are coding, the non-coding ones can be found [here](https://github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Anon-coding).

If you'll be working on a coding issue, follow the [coding setup instructions](/coding_setup.md) to get a local version of the project up and running.
